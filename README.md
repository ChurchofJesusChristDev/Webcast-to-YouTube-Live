The church's web broadcast system is being sunset in June 2022. \
The approved alternatives are Zoom and YouTube Live.

Although Zoom is more straightforward to use on a one-off basis,
YouTube Live is a much better **push-button solution** for regular meetings.

# 4. How to set up YouTube Live (streams)

After 24 hours, when your account is active, you'll want to activate some **privacy settings**:

1. Sign in to YouTube Studio for your Channel Account
   - Sign in to https://youtube.com
   - Select your Church channel from list under the Account Icon in the upper right \
     **Note**: it may appear under the "Switch Accounts" list
   - Click on your Account Icon in the upper right (again)
   - Select "YouTube Studio"
     https://studio.youtube.com/
2. Open the Live Settings
   - Click **üé• Create**
   - Select **Go Live**
   - Select **Right Now** and Start \
     (or Later Date, it doesn't really matter)
   - Select **Streaming software** and Go
3. Edit **Stream Settings**
   - Ultra low-latency \
     (**less delay** between real life and the stream)
   - **Unlist** live replay once stream ends \
     (doesn't show the recording in the public video list - but doesn't delete it either)

   - Click "Edit", up by Title

     - Uncheck "Allow Embedding"
   - Under "Customization"
     - Uncheck "Live chat" (or limit to Subscribers)

If you want **more privacy**:
- Use **Schedule Stream** each week (rather than a default stream)
- Completely _unlist_ the stream by default (back in channel settings, and stream settings)
- Email the scheduled link out to members each week

That all said, before you can actually "Go Live", you need a Stream Key and broadcast software...

# 5. How to get a Stream URL + Key

üö® üò¨ You don't want **dirty content** on your live channel, so read this carefully.

There are a bunch of hooligans out there that enjoy "Zoom-bombing" (pulling distasteful pranks)
and if they get ahold of your stream key, they can publish whatever they want to your channel.

Your unwitting subscribers will get a link to whatever they publish.

Whoever has a laptop or phone that has a stream key should keep it safe:
- üîê Password protect the device
- üîû Keep out of the hands of mischievous kids (i.e. in the congretation)
- üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Report to the tech specialist if a device with a stream key is taken

_With all that out of the way..._

1. Sign in to YouTube Live for your Channel Account
   - Sign in to https://youtube.com
   - Select your Church channel from list under the Account Icon in the upper right \
     **Note**: it may appear under the "Switch Accounts" list
   - Click on your Account Icon in the upper right (again)
   - Select "YouTube Studio"
     https://studio.youtube.com/
   - Click **üé• Create**
   - Select **Go Live**
2. Open the Key Manager
   - Click on the Stream (broadcast) icon in the left menu
   - Look under "Stream key"
   - Look under "Select stream key"
   - Select **Create new stream key** (or **Manage stream keys**)
3. Create a new Stream Key
   - Give the Key a name, such as "Church iPhone"
   - Leave Streaming protocol as RTMP (for most software: Larix, OBS, etc)

What it looks like:

```txt
Stream URL: rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2
Stream Key: xxxx-xxxx-xxxx

Stream URL + Key: rtmp://a.rtmp.youtube.com/live2/xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
(same as above, but joined together with a '/')
```

üö® If you ever need to disable a key because a device was stolen or gotten into
(or you don't trust the person you gave it to), you can simply go back to **Manage stream keys** and remove that key.
